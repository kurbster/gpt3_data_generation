# gpt3_data_generation
Testing how well GPT3 can generate data.

This repo was created with python 3.8. We recommend using [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html), _which is a better version of conda_, to create your virtual environment `mamba create -n myenv python==3.8`. Then installing the requirements with 
`pip install --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116 -r requirements.txt`. Where the `extra-index-url` points to the correct cuda version url you want for your pytorch install.
